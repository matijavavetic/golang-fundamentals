- How to run the program: go run filename.go

- Go CLI:
go build -> compiles the program (does not execute)
go run -> compiles and executes one or two files
go fmt -> formats all the code in each file in the current dir
go install -> compiles and "installs" a package
go get -> downloads the raw source code of someone else's package
go test -> runs any tests associated with the current project

[PACKAGES]

- Packages are like namespaces
- Types of packages:
    - executable -> generates a file that we can run
    - reusable -> code used as 'helpers'. Good place to put reusable logic

- Why is package named main? Word 'main' indicates that package is used to make it an executable type
- Package main MUST have a func called 'main'
- Any other package name cannot be compiled into an executable file, instead it can be as a dependency (helper code)

[IMPORTS]

- import is used to import some kind of package and all its functionalities into our package
- fmt is standard library go package for I/O shortened for 'format'
- golang.org/pkg -> list of standard library packages
