[Basic Go Types]

- bool, string, int, float64

[Variabe declaration examples]

var card string = "Ace of Spades"
card := "Ace of Spades"

- In the first example we explicitly said that var is of type string
- Second example uses ":=" which tells Go compiler to figure out which type to assign
- ":=" is only used when defining a new variable
- If we are reassigning the value of existing variable, we don't have to use :=
- We can initialize a variable outside of a function, but we can't assign the value to it
- Variables must first be initialized with the ':=' operator or the 'var variableName type' syntax
