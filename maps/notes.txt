[DECLARING MAPS]
- First way:
    colors := map[string]string{
	    "red": "#ff0000",
	    "green": "#4bf745",
    }

- Second way: var colors map[string]string
- Third way: colors := make(map[string]string)

[DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAPS AND STRUCTS]
- Map:
    - all keys must be the same type
    - all values must be the same type
    - keys are indexed - can iterate over them
    - use to represent a collection of related properties
    - don't need to know all the keys at compile time
    - reference type

- Struct: 
    - values can be of different types
    - keys don't support indexing
    - you need to know all the different fields at compile time
    - use to represent a "thing" with a lot of different properties
    - value type
