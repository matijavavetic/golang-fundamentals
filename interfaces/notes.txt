[INTERFACES]
- Example:
type bot interface {
    getGreeting(string, int) (string, error)
}
- No need to name variable names, only type of each parameter in a function
- Interfaces are not generic types
- Interfaces are implicit -> we don't manually have to say that our custom type satisfies some interface
- Interfaces are a contract to help us manage types -> GARBAGE IN -> GARBAGE OUT. If our custom type's implementation of a function is broken then interfaces won't help us
- Interfaces are tough. Step #1 is understanding how to read them -> understand how to read interfaces in the standard lib. Writing your own is tough and requires experience
